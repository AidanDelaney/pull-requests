# jupyterlab-pullrequests

A JupyterLab extension for viewing and commenting on pull requests

## Important Note

This version (pre JupyterLab 1.0) of the extension requires a local depedency of `jupyterlab-git` because the networked version is blocked on [this](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/pull/384). I could not get relative local dependencies to work ([see here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4599)) and the local dependency will be removed soon, so in the meantime please use the workaround below.

Go to `package.json` and replace the dependency
```json
"@jupyterlab/git": "./jupyterlab-git.tgz",
```
with
```json
"@jupyterlab/git": "/absolute/path/to/jupyterlab-git.tgz",
```

## Installation

### 1. See development install directions below

### 2. Getting your access token from GitHub

You can get an access token by following these steps:

1.  [Verify](https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-email-address) your email address with GitHub.
1.  Go to your account settings on GitHub and select "Developer Settings" from the left panel.
1.  On the left, select "Personal access tokens"
1.  Click the "Generate new token" button, and enter your password.
1.  Give the token a description, and check the "**repo**" scope box.
1.  Click "Generate token"
1.  You should be given a string which will be your access token.

Remember that this token is effectively a password for your GitHub account.
_Do not_ share it online or check the token into version control,
as people can use it to access all of your data on GitHub.

### 3. Setting your access token in JupyterLab Pull Requests

You now need to add the credentials you got from GitHub
to your notebook configuration file. Instructions for generating a configuration
file can be found [here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_overview.html#configure-nbserver).
Once you have identified this file, add the following lines to it:

```python
c.GitHubConfig.access_token = '<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

where "`<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`" is the string value you obtained above.

Congrats, you did it! Launch JupyterLab and look for the Pull Request tab on the left! ðŸŽ‰
